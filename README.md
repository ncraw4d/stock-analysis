# Stock Analysis Using Refactoring
## Summary of Project
The purpose of the analysis was to use an existing VBA macro and change it to run through the code more efficiently. The goal was to make the code be able to run through more data than what the initial code could run through. By using a timer in the code, it allowed for the efficiency to be tracked.

There is not a difference between the time it took to run the code in the original file and the refactored file. The numbers are the same in the 2017 file for the Total Daily Volume and the Return. Only in the original file the return is not shown as a 00.0% as in the refactored file.

The time it takes to run the code in the 2018 year is also very similar between the original file and the refactored file. The numbers, however, are different. 
##### Summary
The advantages of refactoring code is a person can see what the original code did which gives an idea for how to improve upon it. One disadvantage is one coder may use different terminology to code in VBA which could create more work for a person who prefers using another method. Another disadvantage is if a coder is a beginner, it can be difficult to navigate how to make the new code work with the existing code.
The pros of refactoring an original VBA script is a framework all ready exists and the coder does not have to start from scratch. The con is there is not an ability to be creative unless it is within the existing expecations that are given.
