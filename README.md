# Stock Analysis Using Refactoring
##Summary of Project
The purpose of the analysis was to use an existing VBA macro and change it to run through the code more efficiently. The goal was to make the code be able to run through more data than what the initial code could run through. By using a timer in the code, it allowed for the efficiency to be tracked.
